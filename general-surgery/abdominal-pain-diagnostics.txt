# Diagnostic Studies for Acute Abdominal Pain

### Imaging
**Plain abdominal radiography**

-  When compared to unenhanced helical CT, 3-view xrays demonstrated: 
	- Sensitivity = 30%, Specificity = 88%, Accuracy = 56%
	- Negative predictive value = 51%
- Indications for plain film if suspicious for:
	- Pneumoperitoneum (although upright CXR is better)
	- Small bowel obstruction (where CT not readily available) 
    - Localization of foreign body ingestion OR catheter 
    
**CT Abdomen Pelvis**

- Median radiation dose = 15-31 mSv (CXR has 0.1 mSv dose.)
- Oral contrast likely does NOT provide more information. Known 241-minute delay.

**Ultrasound**

- Increasing use of bedside U/S for point of care testing in EDs.
- Advantage: can be used for unstable patients, no radiation exposure

### Diffuse Abdominal Pain
Lactate useful adjunct to risk stratify for mortality. 

|Lactate (mmol/L) |28-day mortality|Death < 3 days|
|:-----------------:|:---:|:-------------:|
| < 2.5 | 4.9% | 1.4% |
| 2.5 - 3.99 | 9.0% | 4.5% |
| > 4 | 28.4% | 22.4% |

### Diseases
**Appendicitis:** CT is first-line, unless pediatric or pregnant patient. Then U/S is first
line. MRI is an alternative to avoid CT radiation risk.

**Cholecystitis:** Normal LFTs do NOT rule it out. LFT’s helpful as adjunct to
determine likelihood for common bile duct stone.

**Diverticular disease: ** Prevalence < 5% (age < 40 yrs), 30% (age 41-60 yrs), 65%
(age 61-85 yrs).

**Ectopic pregnancy:** Discriminatory zone for gestational sac is B-HCG ≥ 6,500
(transabdominal U/S) or B-HCG ≥ 1,500 (transvaginal U/S)

**Mesenteric ischemia** of concern because of subtleties in presentation. 

- Multidetector CT angiography with reformats: Sens 96%, Spec 94%
- MR angiography: Sensitivity 85-90% (SMA), 75-90% (celiac artery), 25% (IMA) • 

**Nephrolithiasis:**

- Microscopic hematuria - sens 89%, spec 29%
- First line imaging: CT – sens and spec 98-100%
- If hx of nephrolithiasis, use U/S (assuming low-risk for alternative dx)

**Pancreatitis:** Lipase (sens 90%, spec 93%) better than Amylase (sens 79%, spec 93%). Unlike level of elevated enzymes, CT correlates with severity.

**UTI:** Urine dipstick alone is adequately predictive, except for children, elderly, suspected urosepsis.

- Nitrites: Odds Ratio = 6.36
- Leukocyte esterase: OR = 4.52 - Blood: OR = 2.23

**LUQ Pain:** Limited use for labs/imaging, unless elderly, immunosuppressed, or trauma pt.
