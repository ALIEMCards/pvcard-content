# Streptococcal Pharyngitis

- Most cases of pharyngitis are viral
- Most cases of bacterial pharyngitis are caused by  Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus
	- Incidence 15-30% (children) and 5-20% (adults) Peak season = late winter/ early spring
- Transmission is via respiratory secretions
- Incubation period 24-72 hours
- Antibiotics shorten symptoms by 16 hours

### Modified Centor Scoring

** Score calculation**

| Criteria								| Points (Total = 5) |
|------------------------------------|:------------------------:|
| Absence of cough			| 1|
| Swollen and tender cervical nodes| 1 | 
| Temp > 100.4F (38C) | 1|
| Tonsillar exudates or swelling | 1 |
| Patient age: ||
| - 3-14 yr | 1|
| - 15-44 yr | 0 |
| - 45 yr and older | -1 |

** Treatment based on score **

| Modified Centor Score | Incidence of GABHS | Plan |
|:--------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|--------|
| 0 | 1-2.5% | No testing, no antibiotics |
| 1 | 5-10% | No testing, no antibiotics |
| 2 | 11-17% | Do rapid antigen test |
| 3 | 28-35% | Do rapid antigen test |
| ≥ 4| 51-53%  | No testing, empiric antibiotics |

### National Organization Guidelines

1. How to screen for  strep pharyngitis:
	- **ACP, CDC, AAFP**: Use Centor criteria to decide testing and antibiotics
    - **AAP, IDSA**: Use clinical & epidemiological findings to assess risk for GABHS (includes Centor scores)
2. Diagnostic test
	- **ACP, CDC, AAFP**: Rapid antigen test only for Centor scores of 2 or 3 only
    - **AAP, IDSA**: Rapid antigen test or throat culture for ALL patients at risk
3. Backup culture needed if rapid antigen test is negative?
	- **ACP, CDC, AAFP**: adults - no; children - yes
    - **AAP**: children - yes
    - **IDSA**: adults- no; children - yes
4. Who gets antibiotics?
	- **ACP, CDC, AAFP**: Empiric abx for Centor score of ≥ 4, or those with positive rapid antigen test result
    - **AAP, IDSA**: Positive rapid antigen test or throat culture
5. Which antibiotic?
	- <span class="drug">penicillin V</span> oral, <span class="drug">penicillin G benzathine</span> IM, or <span class="drug">amoxacillin</span> oral
6. Which antibiotic, if allergic to PCN?
	- <span class="drug">erythromycin</span>, or first-generation cephalosporin
