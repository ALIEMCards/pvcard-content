# Acute Vestibular Syndrome vs Stroke

**Acute vestibular syndrome (AVS):** Acute dizziness with N/V, unsteady gait, nystagmus, intolerance to head motion, and lasts ≥24 hrs; no focal neuro signs (hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, gaze palsy)

- Most common causes: Vestibular neuritis (labyrinthitis) and vertebrobasilar CVA 
- Central causes: Vertebrobasilar CVA (83%), multiple sclerosis (11%), other (6%)
- Over 50% of vertebrobasilar CVA’s have no focal neuro deficit
- Excludes benign positional vertigo and Meniere’s (< 24 hrs of continuous sx)

**Which *bedside* tests can help differentiate peripheral from central causes of AVS?**

### NOT HELPFUL

- Differentiating type of dizziness (vertigo, presyncope, unsteadiness)
- Onset of dizziness (sudden vs gradual)
- Provocative head movement (eg. Hallpike-Dix)
- Proportionality of sx such as severity of dizziness, vomiting, gait impairment (eg. severe gait impairment with mild dizziness does not mean central cause)
- Hearing loss
- Patterns and vectors of nystagmus
- Noncontrast head CT has sensitivity of only 16% for acute ischemic CVA

### HELPFUL

- **Multiple prodromal episodes of dizziness** – Predictive of central cause (CVA)
- **Headache or neck pain** – Predictive of central cause (CVA, vertebral artery dissection) with positive LR = 3.2. Absence of pain not as predictive.
- **Any neurologic signs, esp. truncal ataxia** (unable sit upright with arms crossed) and severe gait instability – Strongly predictive of central cause
- **Horizontal head impulse test** (vestibular-ocular reflex) – If normal, predictive of central cause (positive LR 18.4, negative LR 0.16)
- **Gaze-evoked nystagmus** (right-beating nystagmus on right gaze and left-beating nystagmus on left gaze) = dysfunction of gaze-holding structures in brainstem and cerebellum – If abnormal, predictive of central cause (specificity 92%, sens 38%)
- **Vertical ocular misalignment on alternate cover test** – If abnormal skew deviation, predictive of central cause (specificity 98%, sens 30%)
- **Diffusion-weighted MRI** is good but not perfect - Sensitivity 83% for ischemic CVA

### H.I.N.T.S. EXAM

- **H**ead **I**mpulse test
- Gaze-evoked **N**ystagmus
- **T**est of **S**kew

Abnormal findings summarized using INFARCTs acronym:

- **I**mpulse **N**ormal
- **F**ast-phase **A**lternating
- **R**efixation on **C**over **T**est

If any 1 of 3 abnormal, sensitivity 100% and specificity 96% for central cause

HINTS test seems just as good as diffusion-weighted MRI to r/o CVA in AVS.
