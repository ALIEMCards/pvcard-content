# Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) = 5x risk for CVA and increases with age 

**Stroke risk stratification for patients with AF:**

- Prior CVA or TIA
- HTN
- Age≥75
- CHF
- Poor LV function
- DM

**CHADS2 stroke risk score:**

- C = Congestive heart failure (1 pt)
- H = Hypertension (1 pt)
- A=Age≥75(1pt)
- D=DM(1pt)
- S2 = prior Stroke or TIA (2 pts)

### Antithrombotic therapy based on risk factors

- If age < 60 years and zero risk factors: No anticoagulation b/c low risk for CVA
- Anticoagulation goal with <span class="drug">warfarin</span> is INR 2-3

**Weak Risk Factors**
Treat with <span class="drug">aspirin</span> or <span class="drug">warfarin</span>

- Female gender 
- Age 65-74 
- Coronary artery disease 
- Thyrotoxicosis

**Moderate Risk Factors**
Treat with <span class="drug">aspirin</span> or <span class="drug">warfarin</span> (1 risk factor) or <span class="drug">warfarin</span> (>1 risk factor)

- Age > 75 
- hypertension
- Heart failure LVEF ≤ 35% 
- Diabetes mellitus

**High Risk Factors**
Treat with <span class="drug">warfarin</span>

- Prior CVA, TIA, embolism 
- Mitral stenosis 
- Mechanical heart valve
