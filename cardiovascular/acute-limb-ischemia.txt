# Acute Limb Ischemia

**_True vascular emergency_**

**Golden Window** = 6 hours (before irreversible neuromuscular damage) 
**Etiologies:** typically thromboembolic cause
**Less common causes:** Vascular dissection, compartment syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome, trauma, vasospasm, vasculitis, low intravascular volume

**Focused physical exam**
1. **Cardiac** – check for murmur, atrial fibrillation
2. **Extremity** – check for signs of chronic peripheral vascular dz (foot
ulcer, decrease arterial pulse in contralateral extremity,
hair loss, muscle atrophy)
3. **Neurological** – check for sensory and motor loss
4. **Ankle-brachial index measurement**

- ABI = (highest of DP or PT pressure on that side) / (highest of left or right brachial artery pressure)
    
5. **Vascular** – grade peripheral pulses

|Grade|Finding|
|---------|-----------|
| 0 | No Doppler signal |
| 1 | Reduced pulse |
| 2 | Normal |
| 3 | Increased pulse |
| 4 | Bounding pulse |
    
 ### Rutherford Classification scheme for ALI
 
- Thrombotic occlusions usually class I or IIA because of presence of collateral vasculature
- Embolic occlusions usually class IIB or III

 **Class I**
 - Category: Viable
 - Prognosis: No immediate limb threat
 - Sensory Loss: None
 - Muscle Weakness: None
 - Arterial Doppler: Audible
 - Venous Doppler: Audible
 
 **Class IIA**
 - Category: Threatened, marginal
 - Prognosis: Salvagable if treated promptly
 - Sensory Loss: Minimal, none
 - Muscle Weakness: None
 - Arterial Doppler: +/- Audible
 - Venous Doppler: Audible
 
 ** Class IIB**
 - Category: Threatened, immediate
 - Prognosis: Salvagable if treated immediately
 - Sensory Loss: More than just toes
 - Muscle Weakness: Mild to moderate
 - Arterial Doppler: Rare audible
 - Venous Doppler: Audible
 
 ** Class III**
 - Category: Irreversible
 - Prognosis: Limb loss or permanent damage
 - Sensory Loss: Profound
 - Muscle Weakness: Profound
 - Arterial Doppler: None
 - Venous Doppler: None
 

### ED Tests
- ABI, EKG
- CBC, Type and screen, Basic metabolic panel, PT/PTT,
Creatine kinase (CK), Troponin
- First line imaging = Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
- U/S, CTA, MRA – not well studied in ALI and loss of time-to-
intervention
- No imaging if unstable patient --> go straight to amputation

### ED Treatment
- ASA
- Unfractionated heparin (consider no bolus and lower infusion
b/c risk of hemorrhage)
- Position extremity in dependent position
- Avoid extremes of temperature
- Pain control

### Management Plan
	
    - Interventional radiology = Catheter-directed (intra-arterial)
thrombolysis +/-Mechanical thrombectomy: If Class I or IIA ischemia; duration <14 days, esp if bypass graft; high operative risk

	- Operating room for open thrombectomy, bypass: If Class IIB or III ischemia; symptoms > 14 days

	- Amputation: If class III and high risk for reperfusion injury
