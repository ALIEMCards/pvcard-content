# Angioedema

**Definition:** self-limited, asymmetric, localized, non-pitting swelling

**Background**

- 15% of population; 50% present with urticaria
- Common sites: periorbital, lips, tongue, extremity, bowel wall
- Main cause of death = laryngeal edema (25-40% mortality if present)

**Syndromes**

1. Idiopathic Angioedema

	- 38% of patients
    
2. Allergic or IgE Mediated Angioedema

	- Type I hypersensitivity reaction
	- Commonly from food or medications
	- Tx: allergen avoidance, antihistamine, H2 blockers, glucocorticoid, epinephrine for laryngeal edema
    
3. Hereditary Angioedema

	- C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency
    - Triggers include: trauma (especially dental trauma), anxiety, menstruation, infection, exercise, alcohol consumption, and stress
	- Prophylaxis tx = <span class="drug">danazol</span> better than <span class="drug">tranexamic acid</span> and <span class="drug">aminocaproic acid</span>
	- Acute tx = <span class="drug">FFP</span> (or C1 inhibitor concentrate - given in Europe/Canada only), usual IgE-mediated treatment regimen ineffective except epinephrine for laryngeal edema
    
4. ACE Inhibitor Angioedema

	- Up to 2.2% of those taking <span class="drug">ACE-I</span>’s
	- From elevated levels of bradykinin
	- Highest incidence during 1st month of starting medication, but can occur years after
	- 5x more common in African-Americans compared to Caucasians
	- Controversial whether patient can take <span class="drug">ARB</span>s (doesn’t cause elevated bradykinin) as well – some with angioedema.
	- Tx = discontinue med, usual IgE-mediated treatment regimen ineffective except epinephrine for laryngeal edema

**Treatment philosophy: **Low threshold to protect airway by intubation
**Pearl: ** Be sure to prescribe patients <span class="drug">Epi-pen</span>

### Admission Guidelines for Angioedema
*Ishoo E et al. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1999; 121:263-8.*

- Retrospective study of 93 episodes in 80 patients (1985-95) with no deaths 
- 9.7% cases required intubation/tracheostomy

**Causes:** 39% from ACE-I (generally more severe than allergic angioedema) 
**Disposition:** 25% outpt, 23% floor, 53% ICU
**ICU admissions** correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, rash Airway intervention correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, stridor

**Proposed staging system:**

- Stage I: Facial rash, facial edema, lip edema - outpatient
- Stage II: Soft palate edema – outpatient or floor
- Stage III: Lingual edema --> ICU (7% of stage III pts got airway intervention) 
- Stage IV: Laryngeal edema –> ICU (24% of stage IV pts got airway intervention)
