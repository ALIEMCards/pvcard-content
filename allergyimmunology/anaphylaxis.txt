# Anaphylaxis

**Definition:** a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and might cause death
**Mechanism:** IgE-mediated immune reaction
**Pearl:** Hypotension is NOT required to diagnose anaphylaxis
**Triggers:** Almost any food, allergens, or medication can be a trigger
- common culprits: antibiotics (esp. beta-lactams), NSAIDs, peanuts, shellfish
**Organ Involvement:** Skin 80-90%, Resp. 70%, GI 45%, CV 45%, CNS 15%
**Biphasic anaphylaxis pattern:** 2nd flare may occur despite trigger removed (typically within 72 hours of onset)

### Diagnostic Criteria
> Highly likely if 1 of 3 criteria fulfilled per 2nd National Institute of Allergy and ID/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network

1. Acute onst (minutes - several hours) with invovlement of skin, mucosa, or both (e.g. hives, pruritis, flushing, facial angio edema) AND at least 1 of following:
	- Respiratory compromise (e.g. shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
	- Reduced BP or associate symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g. hypotonia, syncope, incontinence)
    
2. Two or more of following that occur rapidly after exposure to likely allergen
	- Involvement of skin-mucosal tissue
    - Respiratory compromise
    - Reduced BP or associated dx
    - Persistent GI symptoms
    
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen
	- Infants/children: Low SBP (age specific) or > 30% decrease in SBP
    - Adults: SBP < 90 mmHg or > 30% decrease in person's baseline
    
> *Low Pediatric SBP Definitions*
> Age 1mo - 1yr:	SBP < 70 mmHg
> Age 1yr - 10yrs: 	SBP < (70 mmHg + age*2)

### ED Management
1. Supine position, ABCs
2. <span class="drug">IM epinepherine</span> STAT. Repeat every 5-15min if refractory
	- 0.3 - 0.5mg for adults = 0.3-0.5 mL of 1:1000 concentration of epinepherine
    - 0.15 mg of pt wt < 30kg
    - **IM injection into lateral thigh** -- quickest absorption centrally
3. IV fluids: 2 liters
4. <span class="drug">H1 antagonist</span> e.g. diphenhydramine
5. <span class="drug">H3 antagonist</span> e.g. ranitidine
6. <span class="drug">Glucocorticods</span> e.g. methylprednisone, may blunt biphasic reaction
7. <span class="drug">Beta-agonist nebulizer</span> e.g. albuterol, for wheezing
8. Consider <span class="drug">Glucagon</span> 3.5-5 mg IV if refractory to epinepherine and on beta-blockers
9. If discharging patient home after observation, prescribe <span class="drug">EpiPen</span>!
